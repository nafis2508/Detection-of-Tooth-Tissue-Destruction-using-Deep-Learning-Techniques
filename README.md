# Detection-of-Tooth-Tissue-Destruction-using-Deep-Learning-Techniques
Course project of CSE465(Pattern Recognition and Neural Network) where we tried to predict three different classes(without cavitation, microcavitation and cavitation) of tooth decay obtained by photomicrography using Deep Learning techniques
