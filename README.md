# Tooth Decay Detection Using Deep Learning Models

## Project Description
This project focuses on developing and implementing deep learning models to detect tooth decay using smartphone microphotography. The goal is to enhance the accessibility of dental diagnostics, particularly for populations with limited access to traditional diagnostic tools. The models were trained and evaluated on a dataset collected through smartphone microphotography, providing a cost-effective solution for early detection of tooth decay.

## Dataset
The dataset was collected via smartphone microphotography, capturing detailed images of tooth tissue. These images were then analyzed to detect signs of decay, a critical step in improving dental health diagnostics and making them more accessible to underserved populations.
